# Medical-Courier-Tracking-System
Medical Courier Tracking System for tracking specimens picked up from clients and delivered to a lab.  This system will work
with a ASP.net MVC 5 frontend and a webapi webservice.  Couries with androids and possibly iphones to scan bacodes and take
notes / indicate type of specimen picked up. System should maintain and indicate specimens scaned in vs specimens scaned out.
Also be able to track the location of the courier for easy routing of stat pickups. I would like to create the mobile piece 
with apache cordova.
